                    <h2>Types of Diabetes: Comprehensive Understanding</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Type 1 Diabetes: Autoimmune Condition</h3>
                    <p>Type 1 diabetes represents an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This type typically develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy. The exact cause remains unknown, but genetic predisposition and environmental factors are believed to play significant roles in its development.</p>

                    <h3>Type 2 Diabetes: The Most Common Form</h3>
                    <p>Accounting for approximately 90-95% of all diabetes cases worldwide, Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. This condition develops gradually over years, often going undetected until complications arise. Key risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, and certain ethnic backgrounds. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 is largely preventable through lifestyle modifications and early intervention strategies.</p>

                    <h3>Gestational Diabetes: Pregnancy-Related Condition</h3>
                    <p>Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth, though it significantly increases future diabetes risk for both mother and child. This condition affects approximately 2-10% of pregnancies and requires careful monitoring to prevent complications for both mother and baby. Proper management during pregnancy can prevent adverse outcomes and reduce long-term diabetes risk.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0D3B66] mb-3">Early Warning Signs of Diabetes</h3>
                        <ul class="space-y-2">
                            <li>• Increased thirst and frequent urination</li>
                            <li>• Unexplained weight loss</li>
                            <li>• Extreme fatigue and weakness</li>
                            <li>• Blurred vision</li>
                            <li>• Slow-healing wounds</li>
                            <li>• Tingling or numbness in hands/feet</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Comprehensive Diagnostic Approach</h2>
                    <p>Accurate diagnosis forms the foundation of effective diabetes management. Our diagnostic protocol at Lotus Polyclinic includes multiple testing methods to ensure precise diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning.</p>

                    <h3>Fasting Plasma Glucose Test</h3>
                    <p>This test measures blood sugar levels after an 8-hour fast. Values ≥126 mg/dL on two separate occasions indicate diabetes. This test provides a baseline understanding of fasting glucose levels and helps identify insulin resistance patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</h3>
                    <p>The OGTT assesses the body's response to glucose load, with 2-hour values ≥200 mg/dL considered diagnostic for diabetes. This test is particularly useful for detecting impaired glucose tolerance and early-stage diabetes.</p>

                    <h3>HbA1c Test</h3>
                    <p>This test provides a 3-month average of blood sugar levels, with values ≥6.5% indicating diabetes. The HbA1c test is valuable for long-term monitoring and treatment adjustment, offering insights into overall glycemic control.</p>

                    <h3>Random Blood Glucose Test</h3>
                    <p>Values ≥200 mg/dL with classic diabetes symptoms confirm diagnosis. This test is useful for immediate assessment but should be followed up with more specific testing for confirmation.</p>
